<h1>Fundamentals of HTML</h1>
<br>

<h3>Text Formatting</h3>

<p>A paragraph with <i>some words that are emphasized</i> and <b>some important words.</b> Followed by some <mark>highlighted words.</mark> Feel free to add any other text formatting that appeals to you.</p>

<blockquote> This is some text <br>
    that is laid out exactly as <br>
    Laid out at the code level without any additional <br>
    markup</blockquote>

<h3>Special Characters</h3>
<p>The browser thinks &lt; is a programming character. Also, &gt; The browser also ignores any line breaks <br>
in your code and any &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white space. To include these you need to use special characters aka characters entities. There are other entities available such as Â£ and & </p>

<h3> Links </h3>
A web page without any links is a unique and peculiar find. You can have links to seperate sites such as <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/">Leeds Beckett.</a> Links to other pages of the <a href="https://www.leedsbeckett.ac.uk/">same site </a>

<h3> Images </h3>

<img src="images/paul.jpeg" alt="picture of man" width="100" height="100">
<p> This image is stored on this server in an image sub-folder<br>
I hope you added an alt attribute to support screen readers<br>
Why not check to see what happens if you try to validate your code using the W3C Markup validation Service without the alt attribute included. If you right-click on your page and chose inspect or
view source you and check your code and see the HTML comment you have added just inside the body tag</p>

<p> Notes: </p>
<ul>
    <li>The final para is automatically word wrapped by the browser and does not contain a line break</li>
    <li> The image has been prepared as small 100x100 image prior to inclusion on the page</li>
    <li>To create a link to another page a simple second page will be needed - put a return link on the page</li>
    <li>To test <a href="second.html">intrapage link</a> you will probably need to resize the browser so that a narrow vertical window is open.</li>
</ul>
